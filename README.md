# simple-amazon-calculator
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a shipping calculator. JS reads the order cost (.value), converts it to a number, and applies a $10 shipping fee via an if condition if the cost is under $40. The final result is displayed using DOM manipulation. Styles and logic are kept separate for clean code. ðŸ’»
