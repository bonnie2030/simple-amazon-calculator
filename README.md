🛒 Amazon Shipping CalculatorThis repository contains a simple, interactive Amazon Shipping Calculator built using foundational web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript).It serves as a practical exercise in DOM Manipulation (Document Object Model) and applying conditional logic to user input.💻 Project DescriptionThis project demonstrates the core principle of making a web page interactive: reading data from a user, processing it with JavaScript, and displaying the result back on the page.Key Features:Input Handling: Reads the order cost entered by the user.Conditional Logic: Implements a simple shipping rule:If the cost is less than $40, a $10 shipping fee is added.If the cost is $40 or more, shipping is free.Result Display: Outputs the final calculated total cost to the screen.JavaScript Concepts Practiced:ConceptExplanationExample UseDOM ManipulationFinding and updating HTML elements based on user interaction.document.querySelector('.js-total-cost')Type ConversionConverting text input from the user (a string) into a number so math can be performed.let cost = Number(inputElement.value);Conditional LogicUsing an if statement to apply different rules based on the order cost.if (cost < 40)Event HandlingRunning a specific function (calculateTotal) when a user clicks the button.onclick="calculateTotal();"Code SeparationUsing distinct classes for styling (.calculate-button) and JavaScript logic (.js-cost-input) for better maintainability.🚀 How to RunClone the Repository: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.Open in Browser: Locate the main HTML file (it contains all the code) and double-click it to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).Interact: Type a cost into the input box and click Calculate to see the total.🛠️ Built WithHTML: Structure and content.CSS: Styling.JavaScript (Vanilla): Logic and interactivity.
